 B32Mtf was a half second idea that took two days to construct while I experienced assistance from a language model A.I. ChatGPT4.
 It is the dawn of home-(A.I). and much like those monochrome monitors and eight bit computers of my youth, there is a gravity I am willing to fall towards with the Age.

 So this is a program that has taken the Million digit file and encoded it, then reads that output in and decodes and writes the decoded out.
 I verified that it decoded the whole 415,241 bytes of the milliondigitfile and so this is good enough to share with other Information Alchemists on https://theoddduckdin.freeforums.net

 What it does:

 It reads a binary file (any file is binary) and expresses that binry number; that any binary file is, in base 32 symbols as defined by GMP and not the standard base32 alphabet as defined in RFC 4648. 
 These symbols are then "moved to front" either in the ENCODE direction or in reverse in the DECODE direction.
 A new (Integer) file is written. 
 It is my belief that "any file any way." Meaning any file can be decoded or encoded even if it wasn't prcessed before.
 To that I add that any file is in a bi-directional (bijective) sequence that I wouldn't be surprised if it cycles back around to the original file for either direction.
 I haven't run this to prove that so there is a challenge if you have the time.

 It it:

 It is a Codec. One can encode and re-encode over and over again because each new file in either direction is a new integer in a (most likely) cycle of integers.
 In this most simple example of construct there may be some Information Alchemy. Maybe one of the "integers" will compress so there is a possible "gold strike" in data-mining in respect of Mark Nelson's (https://marknelson.us/posts/2006/06/20/million-digit-challenge.html).

 In the least context; it is an example of this type of Codec. Using text of the number base and applying the Move to Front algorithm.
 It is functional as far as I know as of October 2023

B32Mtf: A Journey into Information Alchemy

B32Mtf started as a fleeting idea, blossoming into a two-day adventure with the support of ChatGPT4, a language model AI. As we stand at the cusp of the home-AI era, I feel the same allure that I once felt for monochrome monitors and 8-bit computers. It's a gravitational pull that's too intriguing to resist.

Forum for Information Alchemists:
Feel free to share your thoughts and experimentations on The Odd Duck Din Forum.

What Does B32Mtf Do?

The program reads a binary file and converts it into a base-32 representation using GMP's symbols, diverging from the standard base-32 alphabet defined in RFC 4648. These symbols are then re-arranged using a "Move to Front" algorithm, creating an encoded or decoded file.

A Hypothetical Challenge:
Though untested, I believe the sequence of integers produced could cycle back to the original file, presenting an intriguing problem for the curious to solve.

The Essence of B32Mtf:
At its core, B32Mtf is a codec. Each encoding or decoding iteration produces a new integer, possibly within a cycling sequence. In this simple framework lies the prospect of Information Alchemyâ€”perhaps one of these iterations could lead to data compression, akin to striking gold in the realm of data mining.

A Functioning Example:
B32Mtf is more than just an idea; it's functional. Though some debugging scaffolds remain, they serve as an entry point for those interested in further development.

I hope this captures both the technical details and the spirit of your work, Ernst.
